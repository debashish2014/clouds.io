Comparison of cloud services

## About

There are many cloud services out there mainly Azure & AWS, but couldn't find a website which draws a comparison between different services available for a specific task. This repository is an effort to do a simple comparison between them. Links are available for quick navigation. Work is in progress, so the list will grow over time.
